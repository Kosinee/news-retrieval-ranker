  sentences:
  - If the company went bankrupt, the issued public shares that were outstanding at
    the time most likely were voided, in which case your shares are most definitely
    gone.  The company might have done a new stock issuance coming out of bankruptcy
    with a different symbol, and while it could be substantially the same company,
    it doesn't mean much for you.  It's unfortunate this may be the case, but it is
    one of the risks of investing.
  - '"In real life, you''d see spreads like AMZN 04/13/2017 910.00 C 4.90 +1.67 Bid:
    4.75 Ask: 5.20 (with AMZN @ $897 right now) and the fill you''d get on the buy
    side would be closer to the ask. i.e. I''d offer $5.00 and hope that it filled.  Filling
    a $4 bid when ask is $8 isn''t likely unless the stock blipped down enough for
    your price to fill.  Options are a lot like day trading, in most cases. Most members
    here will agree that day trading isn''t investing, it''s gambling. Long term,
    the S&P has been up 10%/yr. But any given day, the noise of the market is a 50/50
    zero sum game. Most long term stock ''investors'' do well. Those who get in and
    out, not so much.  There are aspects to options that are appealing. As you''ve
    seen, the return can be high, even IRL, but your loss can be 100% as well. Let
    me share with you a blurred line - I wrote ""Betting on Apple at 9 to 2"" in which
    I described an option strategy that ran 2 years and would return $10,000 on a
    $2200 bet. A similar bet that ended a year ago yielded a 100% loss. I don''t post
    there very often, as I keep that trading to a minimum.  There are warnings for
    those who want to start trading options -"'
  - '"It is called ""Credit card installments"" or ""Equal pay installments"", and
    I am not aware of them being widely used in the USA. While in other countries
    they are supported by banks directly (right?), in US you may find this option
    only in some big stores like home improvement stores, car dealerships, cell phone
    operators (so that you can buy a new phone) etc. Some stores allow 0% financing
    for, say, 12 months which is not exactly the same as installments but close, if
    you have discipline to pay $250 each month and not wait for 12 months to end.
    Splitting the big payment in parts means that the seller gets money in parts as
    well, and it adds risks of customer default, introduces debt collection possibility
    etc. That''s why it''s usually up to the merchants to support it - bank does not
    care in this case, from the bank point of view the store just charges the same
    card another $250 every month. In other countries banks support this option directly,
    I think, taking over or dividing the risk with the merchants. This has not happened
    in US. There is a company SplitIt which automates installments if stores want
    to support it but again, it means stores need to agree to it. Here is a simple
    article describing how credit cards work: https://www.usbank.com/credit-cards/how-credit-cards-work.html
    In general, if you move to US, you are unlikely to be able to get a regular credit
    card because you will not have any ""credit history"" which is a system designed
    to track each customer ability to get & pay off debt. The easiest way to build
    the history - request ""secured credit card"", which means you have to give the
    bank money up front and then they will give you a credit card with a credit limit
    equal to that amount. It''s like a ""practice credit card"". You use it for 6-12
    months and the bank will report your usage to credit bureaus, establishing your
    ""credit score"". After that you should be able to get your money back and convert
    your secured card into a regular credit card. Credit history can be also built
    by paying rent and utilities but that requires companies who collect money to
    report the payments to credit bureaus and very few do that. As anything else in
    US, there are some businesses which help to solve this problem for extra money."'
- source_sentence: Investment for beginners in the United Kingdom
  sentences:
  - 'After doing this many times, my preferred method is: The reason being that the
    US banks will use every chance possible to take your money in fees. Usually the
    German bank website will tell you what the current exchange rate. You were correct
    in selecting Transfer in $ and got the exchange rate. In my experience if you
    transfer in Euros, the US bank at the other end, will take about 3-5%, because
    they can. Selecting OUR means that you only have the fee taken out by the Source
    bank. By doing shared, it looks like both banks took their full fee. If you chose
    OUR, I''m fairly certain you just would have paid the 1.50 and the 20. Chase would
    not have taken the 15.'
  - Before jumping into stock trading, do try Mutual Funds and Index funds, That should
    give you some good overview of the equity markets. Further, do read up on building
    a balanced portfolio to suit your need and risk apetite. This would help you decide
    on Govt. bonds and other debt instruments.
  - From a purely financial standpoint, you should invest using whatever dollars get
    you the best rate. The general rule of thumb that I've come across is that if
    you are making another person/company change your money into another nation's
    currency, they will likely charge a higher exchange rate than you could get yourself.
    However, it really depends on your situation, how easy it is for you to exchange
    money, what your exchange rate is, and what your broker is charging you to exchange
    to USD (if on the off chance this is truly nothing, then stick with CAD). Don't
    worry about the strength of the USD to CAD too much because converting your money
    before you make purchases doesn't allow you to buy more shares. For the vast majority
    of people, trying to work with national currency exchange rates makes things unnecessarily
    complex.
- source_sentence: Is there any reason to buy shares before/after a split?
  sentences:
  - 'The nature of this question (finding a financial adviser) can make it a conundrum.
    Those who have little financial experience are often in the greatest need of a
    financial adviser and at the same time are the least qualified to select one.
    I''m not putting you or anyone in particular in this category. And of course it''s
    a sliding scale: In general the more capable you are of running your own finances
    the more prepared you are to answer this question. With that said, I would recommend
    backing up half a step. Consider advisers other than strictly fee-only advisers.
    Perhaps you have already considered this decision. But perhaps others reading
    this have not. My (Ameriprise) adviser charges a monthly (~$50) fee, but also
    gets percentage-based portions of certain investments. Based on a $150/hr rate
    that amounts to four hours per year. Does he spend four hours per year on my account?
    Well so far he does (~2 yrs). But that is determined primarily by how much interaction
    I choose to have with him. (I suppose I could spend more time asking him questions
    and less time on this forum. :P) I have never fully understood the gravitation
    towards fee-based advisers on principle. I guess the theory is they are not making
    biased decisions about your investments because they don''t have as much of a
    stake in how well your investments to do. I don''t necessarily see that as an
    advantage. It seems they would have less of an incentive to ensure the growth
    of your investments. Although if you''re nearing retirement then growth isn''t
    your biggest concern. Perhaps a fee-based adviser makes more sense in that scenario.
    Whatever pay structure your adviser uses, it would seem to make sense to consider
    a successful adviser with a good client base. This implies that the adviser knows
    what he/she is doing. (But it could also just be a sign that they are good at
    marketing themselves.) If your adviser has a good base of wealthy clients then
    choosing a strictly-fee based adviser would mitigate the risk of your adviser
    having less incentive to consider your portfolio vs that of more wealthy clients.
    To more directly answer your question I suggest asking several of your adviser
    candidates for advice on choosing an adviser. I suspect you will get some good
    advice as well as good insight on the integrity and honesty of the adviser.'
  - 'There has been a lot of research on the effects of stock splits. Some studies
    have concluded that: However note that (i) these are averages over large samples
    and does not say it will work on every split and (ii) most of the research is
    a bit dated and more recent papers have often struggled to find any significant
    performance impact after 1990, possibly because the effect has been well documented
    and the arbitrage no longer exists. This document summarises the existing research
    on the subject although it seems to miss some of the more recent papers. More
    practically, if you pay a commission per share, you will pay more commissions
    after the split than before. Bottom line: don''t overthink it and focus on other
    criteria to decide when/whether to invest.'
  - 'Look into the asset allocations of lifecycle funds offered by a company like
    Vanguard. This page allows you to select your current age and find a fund based
    on that. You could pick a fund, like the Target Retirement 2055 Fund (ages 21-25),
    and examine its allocation in the Portfolio & Management tab. For this fund, the
    breakdown is: Then, look at the allocation of the underlying funds that comprise
    the lifecycle fund, in the same tab.  Look at each of those funds and see what
    asset allocation they use, and that should give you a rough idea for an age-based
    allocation. For example, the Total Stock Market Index Fund page has a sector breakdown,
    so if you wanted to get very fine-grained with your allocation, you could. (You''re
    probably much better off investing in the index fund, low-cost ETFs, or the lifecycle
    fund itself, however; it''ll be much cheaper).  Doing this for several lifecycle
    funds should be a good start. Keep in mind, however, that these funds are rebalanced
    as the target date approaches, so if you''re following the allocation of some
    particular funds, you''ll have to rebalance as well. If you really want an age-based
    allocation that you don''t have to think about, invest in a lifecycle fund directly.
    You''ll probably pay a lower expense ratio than if you invested in a whole slew
    of funds directory, and it''s less work for someone who isn''t comfortable managing
    their portfolio themselves. Furthermore, with Vanguard, the expense ratios are
    already fairly low.  This is only one example of an allocation, however; your
    tolerance of risk, age, etc. may affect what allocation you''re willing to accept.  Full
    disclosure: Part of my Roth IRA is invested in the Target 2055 fund I used as
    an example above, and another part uses a similar rebalancing strategy to the
    one I used above, but with Admiral Share funds, which have higher minimum investments
    but lower expense ratios.'
- source_sentence: What are the advantages of paying off a mortgage quickly?
  sentences:
  - 'While technically true, a card issuer can cancel your card for almost any reason
    they want, it''s highly unlikely they''ll cancel it because you pay your bills!
    There are many, many people out there that pay their bills in full every month
    without ever paying a cent in credit card interest. I wouldn''t ever purposefully
    incur any interest on a credit card. Related anecdote: I used to have a credit
    card that I only used for gas purchases because they gave 5% off for fuel. The
    issuer eventually discontinued the program (I assume because people like me took
    advantage of it.) So while they didn''t cancel my card, the bonus eventually went
    away. I miss that card. My conclusion: if you can take advantage of promotional
    rates, by all means, go for it. You don''t owe them any favors. Enjoy it as long
    as it lasts.'
  - The reason is in your own question. The answer is simple. They use that code to
    tax the product otherwise it would just be out of pocket expenses.
  - 'From my experience and friends'' experiences, I can say that there are advantages
    and disadvantages for paying off your mortgage quickly. Basically, it depends
    on these factors: the type of the mortgage, its interest rate, your financial
    stability, your skills in making investments and other outside factors, such as
    inflation, liquidity, oppurtunity cost, etc. Paying it off means you save on interest
    ratings, you decrease investment risks and your investment rates are taxable.
    Disadvantages are that you cannot use this money for investing, you cannot use
    this money for tax deductions and that in a state of inflation, not paying it
    off in advance could save you a lot of money.  However, I always recommend to
    read some more on websites that deal with mortgages, and speak with the mortgage
    expert in your bank.Just acquire enough information to make a good assessment.
    An interesting article on this topic - The Advantages and Disadvantages of Paying
    Off Your Mortgage'
- source_sentence: Can paying down a mortgage be considered an “investment”?
  sentences:
  - '"Your #1 problem is the Government both in it''s form as a taxation outfit and
    as a ''law and order'' outfit.  You''d be very surprised at how fast a bank seizes
    your bank account in response to a court order.  Purchase 100 Mexican 50 Peso
    Gold (1.2 oz/ea).  These coins are cheap (lowest cost to get into) and will not
    be reportable on sale to taxing authorities.  That money is out of the banking
    system and legal system(s).  Do not store them in a bank! You need to find a tax
    strategist, probably a former IRS agent / CPA type. With the rest remaining money...  There''s
    an old saying, Don''t fight the Fed.  As well as ""The trend is your friend"".  So,
    the Fed wants all savers fully invested right now (near 0 interest rates). When
    investing, I find that if you do exactly opposite what you think is the smart
    thing, that''s the best thing.  Therefore, it follows: 1) Don''t fight the Fed
    2) Do opposite of smart 3) Do: Fight the Fed (and stay 100% out of the market
    and in cash) We''re looking like Japan so could remain deflationary for decades
    to come.  Cash is king..."'
  - '"Another problem with this plan (assuming you get past Rocky''s answer somehow)
    is that you assume that $50K in construction costs will translate to $50K in increased
    value. That''s not always true; the ROI on home improvements is usually a lot
    less than 100%. You''d also owe more property taxes on your improvements, which
    would cut into your plan somewhat. But you also can''t keep doing this forever.
    Soon enough, you''d run out of physical and/or legal space to keep adding additions
    to the house (zoning tends to limit how much you can build, unless you''re in
    the middle of nowhere, and eventually you''d fill the lot), even if you did manage
    to keep obtaining more and more loans. And you''d quickly reach the point of diminishing
    returns on your expansions. Many homebuyers might be prepared to pay more for
    a third or fourth bedroom, but vanishingly few in most markets will pay substantially
    more for a second billiards room or a third home theater. At some point, your
    house isn''t a mansion, it''s ""that ridiculous castle"" only an eccentric would
    want, and the pool of potential buyers (and the price they''ll pay for it) diminishes.  And
    the lender, not being stupid, isn''t going to go on financing your creation of
    a monstrosity, because they are the ones who will be stuck with the place if you
    default."'
  - If your mortgage interest is tax-deductible, it's generally a bad idea to pay
    down the principal on the mortgage because you'd be losing the tax deduction.
    You could instead invest it in a tax-free municipal bond fund, especially if you're
    in a high tax bracket (including state and local marginal tax rates). For example,
    if you have a 5% rate mortgage on your home, you could invest in a 3.5% municipal
    bond and still come out ahead when you apply the tax deduction to your income
    at a 44% (33% federal + 7% state + 4% city in NYC) marginal tax rate.

First, as @JohnFx noted, you should be wary of the sunk-cost fallacy, or throwing good money after bad. You already lost the money you lost, and there's no point in trying to ""win it back"" as opposed to just investing the money you still have as wisely as possible, forgetting your former fortune. Furthermore, the specific strategy you suggest is not a good one. The problem is that you're assuming that, whenever the stock hits $2, it will eventually rebound to $3. While that may often happen, it's far from guaranteed. More specifically, assuming the efficient market hypothesis applies (which it almost certainly does), there are theorems that say you can't increase your expected earning with a strategy like the one you propose: the apparent stability of the steady stream of income is offset by the chance that you lose out if the stock does something you didn't anticipate."</code>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

  | <code>Is there a general guideline for what percentage of a portfolio should be in gold?</code>                        | <code>I think most financial planners or advisors would allocate zero to a gold-only fund. That's probably the mainstream view. Metals investments have a lot of issues, more elaboration here: What would be the signs of a bubble in silver? Also consider that metals (and commodities, despite a recent drop) are on a big run-up and lots of random people are saying they're the thing to get in on. Usually this is a sign that you might want to wait a bit or at least buy gradually.  The more mainstream way to go might be a commodities fund or all-asset fund. Some funds you could look at (just examples, not recommendations) might include several PIMCO funds including their commodity real return and all-asset; Hussman Strategic Total Return; diversified commodities index ETFs; stuff like that has a lot of the theoretical benefits of gold but isn't as dependent on gold specifically. Another idea for you might be international bonds (or stocks), if you feel US currency in particular is at risk. Oh, and REITs often come up as an inflation-resistant asset class. I personally use diversified funds rather than gold specifically, fwiw, mostly for the same reason I'd buy a fund instead of individual stocks. 10%-ish is probably about right to put into this kind of stuff, depending on your overall portfolio and goals. Pure commodities should probably be less than funds with some bonds, stocks, or REITs, because in principle commodities only track inflation over time, they don't make money. The only way you make money on them is rebalancing out of them some when there's a run up and back in when they're down. So a portfolio with mostly commodities would suck long term. Some people feel gold's virtue is tangibility rather than being a piece of paper, in an apocalypse-ish scenario, but if making that argument I think you need physical gold in your basement, not an ETF.  Plus I'd argue for guns, ammo, and food over gold in that scenario. :-)</code> |
