- source_sentence: Smart to buy a house in college?
  sentences:
  - '"I know, this isn''t a direct answer to your question about unloading a used
    car-- I''ve always donated it to charity and written off the price it got at auction
    on my taxes -- but I think the following might be useful to anyone facing a big
    repair bill: You know your car''s condition. (If in doubt, pay your mechanic to
    evaluate it ""as if he was considering buying it for his daughter"".) If you were
    shopping for a used car, and you found one exactly like yours, in exactly the
    same condition, treated exactly as well as you treat yours (and with all the records
    to prove that), but with the repairs already done... how much would you be willing
    to pay for it? If that number is more than the repair cost, repairing is a good
    deal.  If it''s less than the repair cost, is it enough less to justify the hassle
    of car shopping? If so, unload it and use the repair money to buy something better.
    If it''s in the middle... flip a coin, or pick whichever makes you feel better."'
  - '"People have lost money buying houses in good to great neighborhoods.  It''s
    a pretty large red flag that you state this so clearly ""the neighborhood is pretty
    bad."" I''d rather buy a bad house in a great neighborhood, and spend my weekends
    fixing it up, turning sweat equity into real equity. A two year bet? I''d pass.  Close
    to the school, high demand area, and my answer might change.  (And, ""welcome,
    stranger"")"'
  - You could use a stock-only ISA and invest in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). ETFs
    are managed mutual funds that trade on open exchanges in the same manner as stocks.
    This changes the specific fund options you have open to you, but there are so
    many ETFs at this point that any sector you want to invest in is almost certainly
    represented.
- source_sentence: If the housing market is recovering, why would a REIT index ETF
    (e.g. VNQ) not be performing well?
  sentences:
  - '"I assume your employer does standard withholding?  Then what you need to do
    is figure what bracket that puts you in after you''ve done all your normal deductions.  Let''s
    say it''s 25%.  Then multiply your freelance income after business expenses, and
    that''s your estimated tax, approximately.  (Unless the income causes you to jump
    a bracket.) To that you have to add approximately 12-13% Social Security/Medicare
    for income between the $90K and $118,500.  Filling out Form 1040SSE will give
    you a better estimate. But there is a ""safe harbor"" provision, in that if what
    you pay in estimated tax (and withholding) this year is at least as much as you
    owed last year, there''s no penalty.  I''ve always done mine this way, dividing
    last year''s tax by 4, since my income is quite variable, and I''ve never been
    able to make sense of the worksheets on the 1040-ES."'
  - '"VNQ only holds ~16% residential REITs. The rest are industrial, office, retail
    (e.g. shopping malls), specialized (hotels perhaps?) etc.  Thus, VNQ isn''t as
    correlated towards housing as you might have assumed just based on it being about
    ""real estate."" Second of all, if by ""housing"" you mean that actual houses
    have gone up appreciably, then you ought to realize that residential REITs seldom
    hold actual houses. The residential units held tend primarily to be rental apartments.
    There is a relationship in prices, but not direct."'
  - '"The short answer is that the exchange of the stock in exchange for the elimination
    of a debt is a taxable exchange, and gains or losses are possible for the stock
    investor as well as the bank.   The somewhat longer answer is best summarized
    as noting that banks don''t usually accept stocks as collateral, mostly because
    stock values are volatile and most banks are not equipped to monitor the risk
    involved but it is very much part of the business of stock brokers.   In the USA,
    as a practical matter I only know of stock brokerages offering loans against stock
    as part of the standard services of a ""margin account"". You can get a margin
    account at any US stock broker. The stockholder can deposit their shares in the
    margin account and then borrow around 50% of the value, though that is a bit much
    to borrow and a lower amount would be safer from sudden demands for repayment
    in the form of margin calls. In a brokerage account I can not imagine a need to
    repay a margin loan if the stocks dividends plus capital appreciation rises in
    value faster than the margin loan rate creates interest charges...  Trouble begins
    as the stock value goes down.  When the value of the loan exceeds a certain percentage
    of the stock value, which can depend on the stock and the broker''s policy but
    is also subject to federal rules like Regulation T, the broker can call in the
    loan and/or take initiative to sell the stock to repay the loan.   Notice that
    this may result in a capital gain or loss, depending on the investor''s tax basis
    which is usually the original cost of the stock.  Of course, this sale affects
    the taxes of the investor irregardless of who gets the money."'
- source_sentence: Is it better to pay an insurance deductible, or get an upgrade?
  sentences:
  - '"If it''s an active stock, the Yahoo message boards are inhabited by some clueful
    people. But the signal-to-noise ratio is relatively low, and there are a lot of
    ""interesting"" characters who inhabit the boards as well."'
  - '"I think you have a few choices that cannot be described by math alone: Repair
    current phone:  149 Replace current phone with new model from carrier:  100 +
    cost of new phone Replace current phone with new model on payment plan from carrier:  100
    + cost of new phone + finance charge (could be zero or cleverly hidden). You can
    also replace the current phone with either a used or new bought from a separate
    party.  Quite recently I was selling some gently used IPhones 4S for around $140.   So
    really you have to determine what is most important to you guys.  Is it important
    to have the newest model phone with laying out the least amount of cash now?  Then
    by all means go with the payment plan with your current carrier. Is it most important
    to be financially efficient, while having a good working phone?  Then pay the
    deductible; or buy something gently used.   In my opinion, having a phone payment
    is a losing game, akin to buying a new car every three years or so.  You are buying
    something on time that quickly depreciates and hiding the true cost of the item
    in ""painless"" monthly payments."'
  - '"Okay, definitive answer for this particular company (Toyota Finance) is (somewhat
    surprisingly, and glad I asked) it must be fully insured at all times, including
    liability, even if being stored.  I asked at a dealership and they answered ""just
    fire and theft (of course)"" but I ended up calling their finance department and
    the answer was the opposite. So there you go. Thanks for the answers (and for
    trying to talk me out of wasting money)."'
- source_sentence: My wife and I are selling a house worth $230k-$260k. Its a rental.
    Should we use an agent, limited service listing agent, or FSBO?
  sentences:
  - '"The S&P 500 index is maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, a division of McGraw
    Hill Financial. Changes to the index are made periodically, as needed.  For Facebook,
    you''ll find it mentioned in this December 11, 2013 press release (PDF).  Quote:
    New York, NY, December 11 , 2013 – S&P Dow Jones Indices will make the following
    changes to the S&P 100, S&P 500, MidCap 400   and S&P SmallCap 600 indices after
    the close of trading on Friday,   December 20: You can find out more about the
    S&P 500 index eligibility criteria from the S&P U.S. Indices methodology document
    (PDF).  See pages 5 and 6: Market Capitalization - [...] Liquidity - [...] Domicile
    - [...] Public Float - [...] Sector Classification - [...] Financial Viability
    - Usually measured as four consecutive quarters of positive as   reported earnings.
    [...] Treatment of IPOs - Initial public offerings should be seasoned for 6 to
    12 months   before being considered for addition to an index. Eligible Securities
    - [...]   [...]   Changes to the U.S. indices other than the TMIX are made as
    needed,   with no annual or  semi-annual reconstitution. [...] LabCorp may have
    a smaller market cap than Facebook, but Facebook didn''t meet all of the eligibility
    criteria – for instance, see the above note about ""Treatment of IPOs"" – until
    recently. Note also that ""Initial public offerings should be seasoned for 6 to
    12 months"" implies somebody at S&P makes a decision as to the exact when. As
    such, I would say, no, there is no ""simple rule or formula"", just the methodology
    above as applied by the decision-makers at S&P."'
  - '"In most jurisdictions, both the goods (raw materials) and the service (class)
    are being ""sold"" to the customer, who is the end user and thus the sale is subject
    to sales tax. So, when your friend charges for the class, that $100 is subject
    to all applicable sales taxes for the jurisdiction and all parent jurisdictions
    (usually city, county and state). The teacher should not have to pay sales tax
    when they buy the flowers from the wholesaler; most jurisdictions charge sales
    tax on end-user purchases only. However, they are required to have some proof
    of sales tax exemption for the purchase, which normally comes part and parcel
    with the DBA or other business entity registration paperwork in most cities/states.  Wholesalers
    deal with non-end-user sales (exempt from sales tax) all the time, but your average
    Michael''s or Hobby Lobby may not be able to deal with this and may have to charge
    your friend the sales tax at POS. Depending on the jurisdiction, if this happens,
    your friend may be able to reduce the amount the customer is paying that is subject
    to sales tax by the pre-tax value of the materials the customer has paid for,
    which your friend already paid the tax on."'
  - The answers you'll receive are going to be largely subjective. I can't tell you
    which option would be best for you, but there are plenty of things to consider.  Do
    you know how to sell a home? If your market is hot enough, FSBO may make sense
    as you won't need the marketing power and expertise of an agent. In very hot markets,
    you'll end up with potential bidding wars if you price your house correctly. But
    that's where things start getting tricky. Do you know what your house is realistically
    worth in your market, or are you making assumptions based on Zillow (or similar)?
    Do you know what paper work is needed to complete a FSBO sale? Are you any good
    at negotiating? There are certainly plenty of resources out there for FSBO sellers
    to learn how to do it, but it can be overwhelming.  FSBO isn't really fee free.
    If the buyer has an agent, they'll want a percentage (3%) for setting up their
    part of the sale. Without experience in negotiation, you may be leaving a decent
    amount of money on the table. Also, in negotiations, an experienced agent may
    nickel & dime you with contingencies all the way up until closing. Then there's
    anything you might need to pay for marketing materials and time off from work
    (if needed) to have the house shown. However, if you're in a market where people
    are literally walking up to your door to ask if you'd consider selling and for
    how much (which just happened to a friend of mine), then it might actually be
    a pretty painless process.  Traditional agents charge a fee, but that fee goes
    towards marketing and their experience in sales and negotiations. They do the
    work of getting your property in front of the right people and setting up house
    showings. The work is done on your behalf, and you won't need to alter your personal
    work schedule anywhere near as much as you would with FSBO. They only get paid
    if the house sells. Limited service agents are a bit of an unknown to me, but
    it's more than likely the buyer will have an agent, so assume the higher fee.
    It also appears that the LSA gets paid at least $500 no matter what happens, so
    they're certainly not putting in any extra effort to help get your house sold.
    It appears that you're simply paying to get on their list of homes and get some
    marketing from them, but that's about it. I'd imagine you could get the same exposure
    as a well educated FSBO seller.
- source_sentence: Why is it possible to just take out a ton of credit cards, max
    them out and default in 7 years?
  sentences:
  - You could consider buying a fairly recent used car from CarMax. They have fixed
    pricing, and you'd save a good amount of money on the car (since cars lose tons
    of value in their first year or so).
  - '"Check how long you have to hold the stock after buying it. If you can sell reasonably
    soon and your company is reasonably stable, you''re unlikely to lose and/or be
    taxed and/or pay enough in fees to lose more than the 30% ""free money"" they''re
    giving you.  Whether you hold it longer than the minimum time depends partly on
    whether you think you can better invest the money elsewhere, and partly on how
    you feel about having both your salary and (part of) your investments tied to
    the company''s success? The company would like you to ""double down"" that way,
    in the theory that it may make you mors motivated... but some investment councelors
    would advise keeping that a relatively small part of your total investments, basically
    for the same reasons you are always advised to diversify."'
  - I should apply for everything I can on the same day, get approved for as many
    as I can First it may not sound as easy. You may hardly get 2-3 cards and not
    dozens. Even if you submit the applications the same day; If you still plan this
    and somehow get too many cards, and draw huge debt, then the Banks can take this
    seriously and file court case. If Banks are able to establish the intent; this
    can get constituted as fraud and liable for criminal proceedings. So in short
    if someone has the money and don't want to pay; the court can attach the wage
    or other assets and make the person pay. If the intent was fraud one can even
    be sent to jail.

  | <code>Do I make money in the stock market from other people losing money?</code>                | <code>"Do I make money in the stock market from other people losing money? Not normally.* The stock market as a whole, on average, increases in value over time. So if we make the claim that the market is a zero-sum game, and you only make money if other people lose money, that idea is not sustainable. There aren't that many people that would keep investing in something only to continue to lose money to the ""winners."" The stock market, and the companies inside it, grow in value as the economy grows. And the economy grows as workers add value with their work.  Here's an analogy: I can buy a tree seed for very little and plant it in the ground. If I do nothing more, it probably won't grow, and it will be worth nothing. However, by taking the time to water it, fertilize it, weed it, prune it, and harvest it, I can sell the produce for much more than I purchased that seed for. No one lost money when I sell it; I increased the value by adding my effort.  If I sell that tree to a sawmill, they can cut the tree into usable lumber, and sell that lumber at a profit. They added their efforts and increased the value.  A carpenter can increase the value even further by making something useful (a door, for example). A retail store can make that door more useful by transporting it to a location with a buyer, and a builder can make it even more useful by installing it on a house.  No one lost any money in any of these transactions. They bought something valuable, and made it more valuable by adding their effort.  Companies in the stock market grow in value the same way. A company will grow in value as its employees produce things. An investor provides capital that the company uses to be able to produce things**, and as the company grows, it increases in value. As the population increases and more workers and customers are born, and as more useful things are invented, the economy will continue to grow as a whole.  * Certainly, it is possible, even common, to profit from someone else's loss.  People lose money in the stock market all the time.  But it doesn't have to be this way.  The stock market goes up, on average, over the long term, and so long term investors can continue to make money in the market even without profiting from others' failures. ** An investor that purchases a share from another investor does not directly provide capital to the company.  However, this second investor is rewarding the first investor who did provide capital to the company.  This is the reason that the first investor purchased in the first place; without the second investor, the first would have had no reason to invest and provide the capital.  Relating it to our tree analogy: Did the builder who installed the door help out the tree farmer?  After all, the tree farmer already sold the tree to the sawmill and doesn't care what happens to it after that.  However, if the builder had not needed a door, the sawmill would have had no reason to buy the tree."</code> |
  | <code>Which kind of investment seems feasible to have more cashflow every week or month?</code> | <code>I'll mirror what the others have said in that your expectations for returns are wildly out of line with reality. If you could achieve that with only moderate risk hopefully you can see that you could ladder those returns by re-investing them and become a billionaire in short order. You may have noticed that there are a lot of really financially savvy people who are not billionaires. So the math for your plan falls apart somewhere, obviously. However, in the spirit of being helpful, and with the caveat that super high returns involve super high risk I'll try and point you in the direction where this is theoretically possible, even if the odds would be better buying lottery tickets. One way to get more leverage from your money than just buying stocks is to buy options. With an options strategy your return/loss will be magnified greatly compared to buying stocks. That is, you can lose or gain a much higher multiplier of your original investment. That said, I don't advise doing that with any money that you can't afford to lose every penny of, because you likely will.</code>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
